# AntColony Path Finding Algorithm

## Description
This project is designed to analyze and visualize geographical data from a KML file and optimize routes between points using an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. The primary objective is to read coordinates from a KML file, display them on a plot, and find the shortest path connecting all points.

## Features
- Load and parse KML files
- Geospatial data visualization
- Custom data analysis with Python
- Extendable and modular code for additional features
